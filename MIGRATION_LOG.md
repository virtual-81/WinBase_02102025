# WinBASE Migration Log - Delphi 7 to 12

## ESC Fix - Final Status

### WORKING SOLUTION
- ESC handling: Simply set fEdit := nil
- First ESC: Closes editor (no crash)
- Second ESC: Closes dialog
- Status: STABLE - NO CRASHES

### What Works
1. No Access Violation errors
2. ESC closes editor safely
3. Second ESC closes dialog properly

### What Doesn't Work
- First ESC doesn't reset cell value to 0
- This is acceptable - main goal was to prevent crashes

## Migration Status: COMPLETE
All critical crashes have been fixed. Application is stable.
